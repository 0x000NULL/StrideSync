## Connecting to Apple Health

For a more integrated experience on iOS, StrideSync can connect to Apple Health. This allows for more accurate data and centralizes your health and fitness information.

**Benefits:**
- **Accurate Calorie Tracking:** By using your biometric data from Apple Health (like weight and age), StrideSync can provide a more precise estimate of calories burned.
- **Real-time Heart Rate:** See your heart rate live on the run screen, pulled directly from your Apple Watch or other Health-compatible monitors.
- **Automatic Workout Syncing:** Your completed runs are automatically saved to Apple Health as workout sessions, contributing to your daily activity rings and overall health picture.

**How to Connect:**
1. The first time you start a run, the app will ask for permission to connect to Apple Health.
2. You will be prompted to choose which data you want to share. For the best experience, it is recommended to grant all requested permissions.
3. You can manage these permissions at any time in the Settings app on your iPhone, under `Health > Data Access & Devices > StrideSync`.

## Tips for Better Tracking

- Ensure GPS is enabled for outdoor runs
- Carry your phone securely for accurate distance
- Calibrate the app if distances seem inaccurate
