# Privacy Policy for StrideSync

Effective Date: June 23, 2025

StrideSync ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users ("you", "your"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the StrideSync mobile and web applications (collectively, the "Service").

## 1. What Data Stays On Your Device

We collect and store the following information **only on your device**. None of this data is transmitted to StrideSync servers or any third-party service unless you explicitly choose to export or share it:

- **Location Data**: GPS coordinates and motion data recorded while tracking a run (captured only after you grant location permission).
- **Health & Fitness Data** *(optional)*: Workout distance, duration, energy expenditure, and similar metrics accessed from Apple Health, Google Fit, or comparable servicesâ€”only if you grant permission.
- **App Settings & Preferences**: Units, theme, notification choices, and other configuration information.
- **Run & Shoe Logs**: Your run history, statistics, shoe mileage, notes, and related metadata.

## 2. How Your Data Is Used

All processing is performed **on-device**. We use the data described above to:

- Record and display your runs, routes, pace, elevation, and other metrics;
- Generate progress statistics and charts;
- Remind you about runs or shoe replacement when you enable notifications;
- Apply the preferences you configure in the app.

StrideSync does **not** use analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting services that transmit personal data off-device.

## 3. Sharing and Transfer of Data

StrideSync does not automatically share, sell, or upload your data. Information leaves your device only when **you**:

1. Manually export a backup file; or
2. Share a workout, map, or screenshot using your device's share sheet.

In these cases the transfer is under your control, and StrideSync is not involved in processing the data.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

All information resides in the app's private storage:

- Delete individual runs, shoes, or settings within the app;
- Use the in-app **Clear All Data** option to erase everything; or
- Uninstall the app to remove all StrideSync data from your device.

## 5. Security

Your information is protected by the operating-system sandboxing and security features of your device. Because the data never leaves your device, network-based risks do not apply.

## 6. Your Rights

You control your data at all times. Because StrideSync does not store personal data on external servers, rights such as access, correction, or portability are fulfilled directly through the app's data-management features.

## 7. Children's Privacy

StrideSync is not intended for children under 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has used the app, delete the app and its data or contact us for assistance.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

When we make material changes we will update the **Effective Date** above and display the revised policy in the app.

## 9. Contact Us
